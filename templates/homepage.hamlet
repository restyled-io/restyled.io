  <p>Nudge your team towards consistent coding style with every PR

<section>
  <p>
    <strong>Style is important</strong>. Any time there's more than one way to
    do something in code, inconsistencies will creep in. Besides measurably
    adding to the time it takes to read and comprehend code, inconsistent style
    across a code base can hide bugs, often

    Great tools exist for almost every language to automatically align code to a
    defined style. Through editor integrations or git pre-commit hooks, a single
    developer can give themselves a great work-flow for automatically dealing
    with style. Doing this across a team, on the other hand, can be challenging.

  <p>
    Restyled makes it easy to maintain, or transition to, a consistent coding
    style across your entire organization by integrating directly into your
    existing Pull Request process.

  <h2>How it works

  <p>
    Open a Pull Request on a public repository that changes files in one of our
    <a href=https://github.com/restyled-io/restyled.io/wiki/Available-Restylers>supported languages</a>.
    If it doesn't conform to your preferred style, you'll receive a comment that
    it's been <i>restyled</i>:

  <p>

  <section .how-it-works-highlight>
    <p>
      You'll also get a blocking status on your Pull Request.

        Not a fan? These can be disabled in your
        <a href=https://github.com/restyled-io/restyled.io/wiki/Configuration-Reference#statusesconfig>settings</a>.

  <p>
    Review the differences in the restyled Pull Request:

  <p>
    And, if you like, merge them back into yours.

      If we ever run into trouble, you'll be able to see why:

        And hopefully
        <a href=https://github.com/restyled-io/restyled.io/wiki/Configuration-Reference#pattern>configure around it</a>.

  <p>
    Once you've fixed things up, you'll get an updated status.
