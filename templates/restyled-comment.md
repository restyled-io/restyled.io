Hi there!

I just wanted to let you know that some code in this PR might not match the
team's preferred styles. This process isn't perfect, but when we ran some
auto-reformatting tools on it there were differences. Those differences can be
seen in ##{toPathPiece $ prNumber pullRequest}.

To incorporate the changes, merge that PR into yours.

Sorry if this was unexpected. To disable it, see our [documentation].

Thanks,
