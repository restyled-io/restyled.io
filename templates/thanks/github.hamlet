  <p>
    Thanks for installing the Restyled GitHub App! Here are some resources to
    help you get started:

    <li>
      To get an idea of what kind of things might start happening in your
      Repositories and on your Pull Requests, check out
      <a href=https://github.com/restyled-io/restyled.io/wiki/What-to-Expect>
        What to Expect

    <li>
      To change how Restyled behaves (any files to exclude, which restylers to
      run, if comments should be left, etc), see the
      <a href=https://github.com/restyled-io/restyled.io/wiki/Configuration-Reference>
        Configuration Reference

    <li>
      To change how things are actually <em>styled</em>, you're going to want to
      learn about the
      <a href=https://github.com/restyled-io/restyled.io/wiki/Available-Restylers#available-now>
        individual auto-formatters
      that we run for the kinds of files you edit. In fact, you may already have
      a
      <code>.prettier.json
      or
      <code>.brittany.yaml
      in your repository

    <li>
      If you're happy with Restyled, please consider
